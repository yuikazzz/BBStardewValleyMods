  "CFE_FlowerDance_Kent_y2": "Dancing... singing... all just for the heck of it.#$b#This is what happiness looks like.#$e#I'm grateful to see everyone happy like this. It's... what it's all about, right?",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Marlon_y2": "Such a contrast to my usual environment. *sigh*#$b#Perhaps I should have put more effort into matters of love when I was younger.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Sam_y2": "Hey, I don't care who knows that I like flowers. Anyone who's comfortable in his masculinity has to be honest.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Leah_y2": "I love the waterfall we passed on our way in here. Now, how can I paint it in a way that evokes that exact sound?",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Shane_y2": "Nobody seems to mind if I sorta half-ass it through the dancing.$u#$b#Hope you're not offended, or anything...$3",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Marnie_y2": "Everyone looks so lovely! I can't decide whether this festival makes me feel older or younger. Or maybe a bit of both.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Elliott_y2": "I'm feeling particularly inspired by this scene. I should dig up some of my old sonnets and see if they need any revision.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Gus_y2": "Looks like the weather turned out perfect again for a picnic.#$b#That's definitely a good thing, 'cause I most certainly do not have a backup plan if it rains.$1",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Harvey_y2": "This dance is supposed to be for young people.#$b#I... guess that means I can still participate.$11",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Jas_y2": "Granny Evelyn let me help out with some of the flowers this year!",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Vincent_y2": "I wanna collect one of each color of the flowers here. You gotta be quick, though, when no one's watching.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Willy_y2": "Dorados should be lurking in these rivers pretty soon. They're one o' the rarer catches here in the valley.",
  "CFE_FlowerDance_Leo_y2": "It feels like this clearing is in a whole different world.",

  //Luau
  "CFE_Luau_Governor": "Ah yes, the natural beauty here is lovely, Lewis, but campaigning for Stardew Valley as a tourist destination remains to be decided.#$e#Do tell me about the annual fall fair. Can we expect it to be filled with delicious cuisine?",

  "CFE_Luau_Linus": "Ah, good morning, @! Would you like a piece of breakfast?$h#$e#Oh, right. We're past breakfast time. I must have slept in later than I realized.",
  "CFE_Luau_Pierre": "I got done speaking with the Governor right before you arrived.$h#$e#It went... fine.#$e#He didn't actually respond to me.$s",
  "CFE_Luau_Caroline": "I worked everyone just a bit harder during aerobics this week. We've all earned a little feasting, I'd say.",
  "CFE_Luau_Alex": "Now this is what I'm talking about! Why don't we just do this kind of party every day?$h#$e#We could make Pelican Town into a beach paradise spot for tourists.$h#$e#Hey, maybe I should be mayor someday.",
  "CFE_Luau_George": "I liked the luau better, back when we didn't have those big electronic speakers ruining the atmosphere of the beach.#$e#This was... oh, twenty, twenty-five years ago.",
  "CFE_Luau_Evelyn": "This is just about the spot where I'd build sandcastles as a little girl, all these years ago. I can still picture it.#$e#Oh, this was well before I lived in Pelican Town. My family used to come here on vacation.$h",
  "CFE_Luau_Lewis": "Ah! Governor, do you remember? This is @, one of our premier agriculturalists here in the valley.$h#$b#Psst... Hey @, we're really counting on you this year, okay?",
  "CFE_Luau_Clint": "Welp, time for another helping.",
  "CFE_Luau_Penny": "I have to admit it's a bit fun to watch Mayor Lewis's different facial expressions throughout the day.$h#$e#I hope his conversation with the governor goes well.",
  "CFE_Luau_Pam": "Marnie better be watching that soup carefully. I'm countin' on taking home some leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.",
  "CFE_Luau_Haley": "*giggle* My sister is such a dork sometimes.",
  "CFE_Luau_Jodi": "Kent and I are sharing these little dumplings. They're beyond delicious.$h#$e#I wish Gus would share his recipes more often.",
  "CFE_Luau_Marlon": "This festival is especially uplifting, after spending so much time underground and in the dark.",
  "CFE_Luau_Sam": "Alright, Penny, alright. The anchovies thing was just one year. I promise I won't put anything gross in the soup.#$b#*psst* You, on the other hand, @...$h",
  "CFE_Luau_Leah": "Aren't the first local melons of the season about to come in? Ooh, that sounds so delicious right now.",

  "CFE_Luau_Elliott": "There's a marvelous lobster bisque on the table closest to the ocean. Have you had some yet?$h",
  "CFE_Luau_Elliott.DSV.JewishElliott": "There's a marvelous baked snapper on the table closest to the ocean. Have you had some yet?$h",
  "CFE_Luau_Gus": "I could make a delicious soup, no problem, but the potluck soup is supposed to be more a reflection of the whole valley, not a reflection of me.#$e#I just have to step back and let it be what it'll be!",
  "CFE_Luau_Wizard": "Ever notice how it's always sunny on festival days?#$e#Yeah, you're welcome for that.",
  "CFE_Luau_Harvey": "Is Emily still dancing? Good grief. I told her, dehydration and dance meditation are not the same thing.$11",
  "CFE_Luau_Jas": "Nobody needs a squirt gun to dance, Vincent.",
  "CFE_Luau_Vincent": "You should get a squirt gun and shoot it at my feet, like a cowboy! Then I'll dance like, woo-woo-woo!",
  "CFE_Luau_Willy": "I hope everyone cleans up better than they did last year. This might as well be my backyard.",
  "CFE_Luau_Leo": "There are so many different foods! On the island, I mostly ate the same things every day.",
  "CFE_Luau_Kent": "This is the kind of stuff I dreamed about when I was overseas.$h#$e#It's worth a little reflection.",
  "CFE_Luau_Governor_y2": "That one year, the soup was delicious! Was that last year, or...?#$b#...no, perhaps it was a different year? Ah, I can't remember.",
  "CFE_Luau_Abigail_y2": "Mmmm, @, why don't you grab one of those turkey legs and just chow down like a champ?#$b#Like some kind of medieval gladiator, fresh from the fight?#$e#Well fine, if you won't, maybe I will!$1",
  "CFE_Luau_Robin_y2": "Oh, hi @! It wouldn't be a proper luau without a little dancing, would it?$1",
  "CFE_Luau_Demetrius_y2": "Honey, what was that dance step you taught me at the saloon the other night?",
  "CFE_Luau_Maru_y2": "Hey, here's a game. Watch the mayor, and every time he smiles and says 'Absolutely!' to the governor, you get a point.#$e#It's adorable. I've only been sitting here for a few minutes and I'm already at five points.",
  "CFE_Luau_Sebastian_y2": "If it suddenly rained right now, people would scramble and run away like the rain's made of poison.#$e#Is it bad if the thought of that sight makes me chuckle?$1",
  "CFE_Luau_Linus_y2": "I'm happy to share my roast with you if you'd like, @. Let no part of the animal go to waste, I say.$1",
  "CFE_Luau_Pierre_y2": "If we ever get a storm on luau day, we could always host the Governor in my store.#$e#...What? I could make it work.",
  "CFE_Luau_Emily_y2": "Join in! Don't be shy!",
  "CFE_Luau_Caroline_y2": "I hope you brought an appetite. If you got just a little bit of everything, you still couldn't fit it all on one plate!",

  "CFE_Luau_Penny_y2": "This looks like a nice place to sit, doesn't it?#$e#Mmm, pulled pork and those slippery rice noodles. I think those are my favorite together.",
  "CFE_Luau_Pam_y2": "Aw shoot, I forgot to call in to the bus company for my day off!#$e#Oh well. Is anyone gonna notice?",
  "CFE_Luau_Haley_y2": "Sipping a drink out of a coconut is the best. Have you ever tried it?",
  "CFE_Luau_Jodi_y2": "It's nice having a day off from cooking on a day like today.",
  "CFE_Luau_Kent_y2": "I'll steer clear of the soup. Who knows what could be in there?",

  "CFE_Luau_Marnie_y2": "*yawn* I'm tired. I think I'll sleep like a log tonight, especially after such a feast.$2",
  "CFE_Luau_Elliott_y2": "I didn't forget about the luau this year!$1#$e#Well, Leah reminded me, anyway. That helped.",
  "CFE_Luau_Gus_y2": "Based on what I've seen going into that soup, I'd say a little wine might be safe to add. Or something savory, like cheese or truffles.#$e#It'd have to be the best of the best quality, though.",
  "CFE_Luau_Gus_y2.DSV.TurkishGus": "Based on what I've seen going into that soup, I'd say a little cabbage or cauliflower might be safe to add. Or something savory, like cheese or truffles.#$e#It'd have to be the best of the best quality, though.",

  "CFE_MoonlightJellies_Robin": "My first year in town, I saw the old candle-boat they were using, and I said, \"Hey, I can build something like that.\"#$b#So I went ahead and made one, and Lewis liked it.",
  "CFE_MoonlightJellies_Demetrius": "In my field of study, it helps now and again simply to pause and truly absorb the beauty of the natural world.#$b#It reminds me that we have so much more to learn about nature. In the grand scheme, we've only just started.",

One day, a shark pale as the full moon itself, with fiery eyes, attacked the good captain in his skiff and bit his hand clean off. From that day, the captain changed. He replaced his hand with a silver hook and swore vengeance on the shark, searching the seas relentlessly until his whole crew perished. Some say the captain's ship still shows itself when the full moon shines high, forever searching... for his revenge._No thanks_Suit yourself.'",

Do you think you can take over for me?#$b#It's that lump of snow on the ground.#$e#Er, no, not that lump of snow. The other one.#$e#Actually, that other lump of snow looks better than mine. Maybe use that one? *sigh*$2",
  "CFE_IceFest_Emily_y2": "This old frosty guy's lookin' pretty good, don't you think?$1#$e#Clint deserves some of the credit. He let us borrow the hat, and that's really what makes his outfit pop.",

  "CFE_IceFest_Pam_y2": "Hey kid, maybe you could teach me a thing or two about fishing.#$e#Seems like you got pretty good pretty fast.",

  "CFE_IceFest_Elliott_y2": "I don't know how you find time for fishing with all of your farmwork on top of it all.",
  "CFE_IceFest_Gus_y2": "I sure could use a few of the fish from the competition and do a special at the saloon. It'd be great to pick over the best ones.",
