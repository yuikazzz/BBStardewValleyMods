	"abigail.daily.Tue4": "Hi, I'm glad to see you.$h#$b#I was talking to Seb and he was really chatty. So weird.#$b#Even weirder, he looked like he made some effort to look decent. His hair was under control and his clothes didn't look like he uses a hamper as a dresser, ha!",

	"abigail.daily.summer_Wed4": "I saw some great new furniture in Robin's catalog last time I was there, want me to help you pick some stuff out?#$b#It sounds like so much fun decorating a house just the way you want it. I'll even help you set things up, it gets boring just hanging out around the store.",
	"abigail.daily.summer_Wed6": "You know, with my business degree and your practical knowledge, it would be fun to invest in something together, like a small business or maybe real estate...#$b#Hmm I'll have to think about that... right now, I think we need a water park where we can all cool off. I bet everyone would love that.",
	"abigail.daily.summer_Thu4": "It's so nasty and hot out here, I hope I don't get burned. Hate that! Or get a tan. I guess a tan is better than being fried, but I really don't like that look on myself.$s#$b#You look fine with a tan though, I suppose it's unavoidable when you need to be outside all day. Be sure to take care of your skin!",
	"abigail.daily.summer_Thu6": "Be sure to use that sunscreen I gave you, your tan looks great but you need to be careful not to damage your skin too much.#$b#Oh, yikes I sound like my mom! I just want you to take care of yourself.",
	"abigail.daily.summer_Fri": "I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything.#$b#Oh! Don't tell David I said that, he'd be devastated!$h",

	"abigail.daily.fall_Mon6": "I don't know how Seb can just sit there and stare at his computer all day. Every day. Doesn't he get stir crazy? I can't sit still that long for sure.#$b#I guess he does walk around the lake sometimes but still. I'm glad he's getting out more now that you're here.",
	"abigail.daily.fall_Mon8": "You know, I can see why you wanted to become a farmer, I'm inspired to start my own business when I'm done with college.#$b#You'll help me out, right?",
	"abigail.daily.fall_Tue4": "I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best.$s#$b#Don't tell anyone I said that, especially not Seb or Sam. They'd tease me about it for ages!",
	"abigail.daily.fall_Tue6": "Guess what!! I agreed to guinea pig sit for a friend of mine from Zuzu City a while back, it was pretty fun having two guinea pigs for a while.#$b#BUT I just discovered David... isn't actually a boy! Now I have five little tiny guinea pigs and David! Maybe I should change her name... nah.#$b#The babies are soooo cute, just miniature guinea pigs with all their fur and everything, not like naked mouse babies.#$b#Of course, I have to find homes for them now. You... want a guinea pig?",

	"abigail.daily.fall_Thu8": "Oh, it's such a nice day with a good breeze... hey, let's have a little fun. We can pull our jackets up like sails and let the wind blow us around the square!$h#$b#Then we can find Sam and bother him for a while. Oh, maybe he'll take us for pizza!",
	"abigail.daily.fall_Sat6": "Hi, @! Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?$h#$b#I keep thinking I should change mine, but I can never settle on a style so just keep going back to the same old thing.",

	"abigail.daily.winter_Wed6": "It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year, and that means you can hang out with me more often!$h#$b#Are you up for a movie night? The whole snack food and hot chocolate binge with a good scary movie thing?$h",
	"abigail.daily.winter_Fri": "One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different. I guess that's not unique to Pelican Town, but it's more obvious in a small town.",

	"demetrius.daily.Mon": "Maru helps me out in the lab sometimes... She's a good kid. I started teaching her how to use lab equipment before she started elementary school.",

	"demetrius.daily.Mon6": "I know I sound like a stuffy academic sometimes, Robin has pointed that out on occasion.#$b#Thank you for coming by to check on me at my lab, I do appreciate the company.",
	"demetrius.daily.Tue": "This valley has a very vibrant and diverse ecosystem. That's one reason I was excited to move here.#$b#Robin also loves the valley, she grew up here and it's her home.",
	"demetrius.daily.Tue4": "I'm off to gather some samples at the lake, I've been mapping out the ecosystem and all the species supporting the lake environment. It's fascinating work.#$b#If you happen to catch any fish you don't need, let me know. I might be able to use them, or they could become dinner, haha!",
	"demetrius.daily.Wed": "You're probably growing a lot of interesting plants on your farm, huh?#$b#Maybe I'll stop by your place some day and check it out. If you need any advice on the optimal conditions for specific species, feel free to ask.$h",
	"demetrius.daily.Wed4": "How are your crops growing? I hope all is well.#$b#Have you built a greenhouse? Those are very handy in winter, or for growing any plants you want to harvest year-round.",
	"demetrius.daily.Wed6": "Hi @! How are you doing today?#$b#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow. Be sure to let me and Maru know if there's anything we can do to help improve your farm.",
	"demetrius.daily.Thu4": "How are you today? I've had some minor breakthroughs in my lastest project so it's been a productive day so far.",
	"demetrius.daily.Fri": "I have noticed you chatting with Sebastian, he seems to enjoy your company.#$b#He works on his computer most of the day. Maybe you can encourage him to expand his interests.$u",

	"demetrius.daily.summer_Tue6": "There was a bit of a close call in the lab earlier today, I only turned my back for a moment but my experiment literally went up in a ball of fire as they say, heh!#$b#Nothing was damaged, other than my pride of course.",
	"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed": "I've been attempting to find ways to bridge the gap between Sebastian and myself.#$b#It's challenging since he can be very emotional and difficult to understand.#$b#He does think highly of you, do you have any thoughts on the matter?",
	"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed4": "Hmm I've been working through some data from a previous study that relates to my current project, it's difficult to compare to the current data on my computer.#$b#It would be nice if I could have both datasets open side by side for comparison.",
	"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed6": "I mentioned the difficulty I was having with comparing my project data to Sebastian, he seemed intrigued by the problem and mumbled something about software coding.#$b#Sometimes I wonder what he's thinking about.",
	"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed8": "Sebastian installed a new program on my computer that he wrote to assist in my scientific data analysis.#$b#It's very useful, I can now easily compare the data from various studies and the program will filter and flag unique or similar entries.#$b#It has saved significant time and effort in my work.

	"demetrius.daily.fall_Thu6": "When I was returning with samples from the lake, Sebastian was working on his motorcycle. I stopped to speak with him about the mechanics of the motorcycle engine.#$b#We had a pleasant conversation about some enhancements he'd like to make to the bike, I rather enjoyed it.",
	"demetrius.daily.fall_Thu8": "I want to help Sebastian with his motorcycle, do you think he would like to receive some engine parts for his birthday?#$b#Ah, yes, I will make sure they are the exact parts he wants for upgrading the bike, some of the things he mentioned are not purely focused on practical function.",
	"demetrius.daily.fall_Sun": "Hello, @, have you visited Sebastian today?#$b#Since you and he have become friends, he has a markedly improved outlook on life.",
	"demetrius.daily.winter_Mon4": "I might not seem like the romantic type, but I understand the importance of having someone by your side in life.#$b#I'm glad Sebastian has found that companion in you.",

I'd like to do something for Robin but I'm not confident I can plan an appropriate date.#$b#A nice dinner at the saloon in the private room with flowers? Hmm I think that could be successful, I'll let you know the results.$h",
	"demetrius.daily.winter_Mon8": "Thank you for your advice for an evening out with Robin, she greatly appreciated not needing to cook and she enjoyed the flowers.#$b#Maybe I will take her to see the algae growth I discovered recently.#$b#Oh? You doubt she would enjoy that? Hmm you could be right, she might not appreciate the aesthetics of algae.",
	"demetrius.daily.winter_Wed6": "Sebastian insisted on making a 'snowgoon' by our house, it was so lopsided, I just don't understand why he does that. I asked him to take it down.",
	"demetrius.daily.winter_Wed8": "Why does Sebastian insist on building 'snowgoons'? They're asymetrical, it doesn't make sense. What's wrong with a snowman with perfectly aligned sections?#$b#*sighs* Oh well. I suppose that falls under the design aesthetic Robin always refers to.",
	"demetrius.daily.winter_Thu4": "Humph... Maru built a nice snowman and I told her how well it was designed. Sebastian rolled his eyes and built a 'snowgoon'. What is that boy thinking?",

	"demetrius.reaction.dating_Sebastian": "I hear you and Sebastian are formally dating. To be honest, I'm glad he found you.#$b#I was becoming concerned that his lack of social skills would make it difficult for him to find a life partner.#$b#However, as Robin fondly reminded me, I was able to find someone so maybe I shouldn't have doubted him.$h",
	"demetrius.special.Tue_inlaw_Sebastian": "How's Sebastian doing on the farm?#$b#I hope he's helping but it's hard to imagine him working outside all day.#$b#However, he might be able to design you some software for farm management.$h",
	"demetrius.Event_Lab_Silence": "Well, we'd better titrate this solution before it crystallizes on us, this experiment is a little less forgiving than the kid ones.",

That young man has been fascinated with amphibians for as long as I can remember.#$b#He probably doesn't remember this, but when he was very young, before Maru was born, I took him out on a research trip and we caught tadpoles.#$b#He raised them in his room then released them. Hmm... somehow, I always thought his interest in frogs would lead him to study biology or environmental science.#$b#I suppose I made assumptions then and didn't change my perception of Sebastian as he grew.

I’ve never heard anything like this before. The words swelling from despair to desperation, then softening into longing and... hope...#The music slows as the Seb’s voice fades away, releasing my mind.

Sam grins, but is uncharacteristically silent. He seems to understand, maybe I underestimated his empathy.#Seb looks down then away, avoiding my eyes. I feel the same, I imagine my thoughts are written all over my face. I smile as best I can, maybe I can find the words later...",

	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.2": "Wow, this is going to be a lot of work. I think we need more help.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.3": "Hey guys, what's up? I was on my way to the bathhouse gym. Why are you dragging those nets around? Need help?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.4": "Uh, yeah. We're dredging a section of the lake looking for... stuff that might be causing the frogs to turn blue.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.5": "I heard about that! Grandpa was going on and on about the current generation's disrespect for nature or something like that. C'mon, let's get dredging!$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.6": "There you are, Seb! I didn't find you in your room and that was weird, so thought I'd check the lake. What're you doin' with that net?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.7": "Oh hey, just when I was thinking we needed more people to make this go faster. We're dredging the lake, here, you can help.#$b#Take this end and walk down the shore until we stretch the net out.",

	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.11": "Did someone say pizza? What're you idiots doing anyway?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.12": "C'mon man, cut us a break. We're dredging this part of the lake to see what crap is getting chucked in here.#$b#If you wanna help, there's pizza in it for you, on Seb.$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.13": "Huh... seems pointless, but sure, I'll help drag a net for free pizza. As long as it doesn't involve swimming.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.14": "Seb, I was just thinking, what happens if we dredge up something crazy... like treasure... or a body? Eeesh!#$b#Could we keep it? The treasure I mean, not the body.",

	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.17": "Hey, this looks like a party going on without me! Hi @, boys... and freakin' huge net... What are you trying to catch? A giant squid?$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue4.18": "Oh heck, that would be awesome if we did! We're dredging for treasure. Or bodies, whichever we happen to catch. Want in?$h",

	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.2": "I guess farming has it's advantages, I'm used to that kind of bending and pulling work.#We did dredge up quite a bit of junk to sort though and it's definitely not something Seb is used to doing.#I offer to massage his shoulders, Seb smiles and nods as he looks at his feet.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.3": "I gently massage the knots out of Seb's shoulders and upper back, he sighs softly as his muscles relax.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.4": "Thanks, that feels... great.$l#$b#Th-there's something... I want you to know...",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.5": "Ah, @, I thought I heard your voice. I have some conclusions after sorting through the debris you pulled from the lake yesterday. Come to the lab when you're ready.$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.5.1": "*sighs*",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.6": "Here in this bin are the objects retrieved from the lake.#$b#One item has heavy concentrations of the contaminate and seems to be the source, this can of Joja Blu cola.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.7": "Well that's... honestly not surprising, heh.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.8": "Those Joja morons... what have they been doing, just dumping experimental soda in the lake?$a",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.9": "Unfortunately I don't know why the cans are there, but they are open and leaking their contents into the water.$s#$b#Now that we have the source, we can start working on cleaning the water. I will report this to Mayor Lewis, he can take any legal actions necessary.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.10": "Hello, @! I'm glad everyone is here, I've finished retooling the neutralizer spreading system.#$b#It's a coordinated group of drones that will hover over the lake and spread the granules, providing even coverage over the entire area at once.$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.11": "Excellent, Maru, you worked out the programming?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.12": "Yes! After the... um... runaway robot incident a while back, Seb helped me debug the code so now we won't have any issues with infinite loops. Hehe!",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.13": "There is one more thing we should consider. Since Joja is the culprit, we can't trust them to spontaneously begin caring about the environment and following rules.#$b#Maru, do you have blueprints for a filtration system that could handle a body of water the size of the lake? This would prevent future contamination.#$b#Also, the neutralizing agent can't be used long-term, and needs to be cleared out of the water.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.14": "Hmm, yes, that should be no problem, it would function like the town water filtration system.#$b#I'll improve on it by adding a sensor that will alert us if any new or unknown contaminates are found.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.15": "I'll need about a week to get the filtration system assembled, assuming the parts are available.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.16": "Alright, that will work with the current timetable. First, we will spread the neutralizing agent, which will be effective for 20 to 23 days before it loses potency.#$b#During that time, Maru will assemble and install the filtration system.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.17": "Ah perfect! I love when plans come together like this.$h#$b#I'm off to my secret invention cave again if anyone needs me!",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.18": "Sebastian, you mentioned there could be something unusual about the tadpoles. Do you have an update on that?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.19": "Oh, um, yeah. The tadpoles are growing faster than normal. When we caught them, their legs had barely started to form.#$b#Today, they have their back legs and are nearly at the froglet stage, ready to move out of the water. Other than that, they seem fine.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.20": "Interesting... hmm... keep observing them, if you don't mind, would you measure their size daily and keep a record?",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.21": "S-sure. I'm already doing that. I have the notes on my phone... there, I texted you a copy.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.22": "Ah... fascinating! Hmmm... I wonder...",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue5.23": "@, do you want to go watch a movie or just hang out? I'm really tired but... I'd like to spend some time with you... if that's okay.$l",

	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.1": "Welcome, @, Maru and I spread the neutralizer at daybreak this morning, it all worked perfectly. Maru's drone-flying skills are impressive!$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.2": "If you're looking for Sebastian, he's still in his room. All this activity has worn him out, I'm afraid!#$b#Oh wait, before you go down, I wanted to tell you... how should I put this...#$b#I've observed how your friendship with Sebastian has resulted in a marked improvement in his outlook.#$b#He's noticeably happier, less reclusive, and more open to conversation.#$b#I hope you continue to develop your relationship, I'm quite interested to see how you both grow together.$h#$b#Erm, what I mean is, I'd like to see Sebastian happy and successful in his life, and it seems you play a key role in that.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.3": "That was a little embarrassing, but I'm glad Demetrius is taking an interest.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.4": "*yawns* Oh, sorry... I'm awake. Sort of.#$b#Check out the frogs, they're hopping all over the place, last night Porthos escaped and plopped right on my face. I guess his name is appropriate, heh!",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.5": "There's Athos and Porthos, and the good looking one over there is Aramis.$l",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.6": "Um, thanks for helping with this whole frog thing, it was... fun.$l#$b#I uh, want to tell you...",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.7": "Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt. Sebastian, I just wanted to say thank you for your help.#$b#Everyone played a key role in solving this mystery, and your knowledge of the frogs in this habitat and your help with the drone programming were invaluable.#$b#I... erm... I hope we can collaborate again in the future. Well, I'll leave you two alone, if you need me, you know where I am.$h",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.8": "Yeah... Okay.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.9": "Be-before we get interruped again...$l",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.10": "Sebastian grips my hands, squeezing my fingers, then rubbing them with his thumbs as he decides what to say next.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.11": "You're the most important person in my life. I care about you. A lot.$l",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.12": "Thank you for spending this week with me, I know you're busy and...",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.13": "Seb, shush... this week has been such a fun adventure, I wouldn't have missed it for anything. I slide my hands up Seb's arms, then pull him into a hug. He leans into me, holding me tight.",
	"seb.event.frogsofblue6.14": "Out of the corner of my eye, I see a flash of blue... oh boy, Porthos is on the loose...",
