**IMPORTANT**
*************

*1*

Using the Fishing Difficulty option: "Super Easy; Max Fish Bar & Buff " will ensure that treasure chests will also be caught and grant full fishing xp.
This setting will also give rare fish a better chance of spawning due to the permanent buff it provides. Be aware that some smaller fish may not appear with
this setting enabled!

*2*

If you are using the "Dynamic Weather" settings from the "Fishing Difficulty" category:

 > Easy Setting: Wind = 15% Harder, Rain = 10% Easier, Snow = 15% Easier, Storm = 20% Easier

 > Easier Setting: Wind = 5% Harder, Rain = 20% Easier, Snow = 25% Easier, Storm = 30% Easier

 > Easiest Setting: Wind = 5% Easier, Rain = 30% Easier, Snow = 35% Easier, Storm = 40% Easier

Fish that only come out in certain weather conditions will not be affected if it's the appropriate weather.

(Example: Eel is a rain only fish and the difficulty will not change when it is raining.)

Rain and Sun fish with have opposite effects if using the All Seasons setting or the item in game that makes fish appear in all seasons.

(Example: Pufferfish is a sun only fish and the difficulty will become harder during rainy weather.)

*3*

You will get lower fishing xp when decreasing the fishing minigame difficulty. But do not fear! You'll still get a good amount of xp in a good amount of time with the 100% setting. 
It could be a little slower or a little faster than not having the mod installed.

(Example: At 100% easy fishing, most fish will grant 14 to 21+ xp per perfect catch.)

If you want max xp while using 100% easy fishing, switch to the "Super Easy; Max Fish Bar & Buff" setting instead. This will guarantee fishing chests and full xp!

*4*

Any mod that skips or removes the fishing minigame is fully compatible with Fishing Made Easy Suite!
