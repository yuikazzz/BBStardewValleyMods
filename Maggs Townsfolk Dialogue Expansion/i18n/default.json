I bet everyone would love that.",

		"abigail.daily.fall_Tue4": "I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best.$s#$e#Don't tell anyone I said that, especially not Seb or Sam. They'd tease me about it for ages!",
		"abigail.daily.fall_Tue6": "Guess what!! I agreed to guinea pig sit for a friend of mine from Zuzu City a while back, it was pretty fun having two guinea pigs for a while.#$e#BUT I just discovered David... isn't actually a boy! Now I have five little tiny guinea pigs and David! Maybe I should change her name... nah.#$b#The babies are soooo cute, just miniature guinea pigs with all their fur and everything, not like naked mouse babies.#$b#Of course, I have to find homes for them now. You... want a guinea pig?",

		"abigail.daily.winter_Mon8": "Are you building a snowgoon army on your farm?#$b#Be sure to come get me when you want to get going on that, I love building snowgoons and yours are definitely the wonkiest! Ha!$h#$e#Dad has some past-date produce we can use for noses and stuff, and I bet Emily has fabric scraps for scarves.",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Tue4": "It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share.$h#$e#You know, Sam makes excellent hot cocoa, want to go bother him? I bet he'll make us some.$h",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Wed6": "It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year, and that means you can hang out with me more often!$h#$e#Are you up for a movie night? The whole snack food and hot chocolate binge with a good scary movie thing?$h",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Fri": "One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different. I guess that's not unique to Pelican Town, but it's more obvious in a small town.",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Fri8": "It's always nice and cozy warm in the saloon, come sit with me and I'll show you some fun mobile games I found.#$e#And we can make fun of Sam and Seb as always, heehee!",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Sat": "It's the weekend! Time to play video games and ignore reality for a while, have you played the games at the saloon?$h",
		"abigail.daily.winter_Sat4": "Time to play video games and see if I can beat the next level in Prairie King...#$e#Sam likes to remind me he's way better at it, one of these days I'm going to beat that guy.",

		"abigail.daily.spring_12": "I'm definitely going to enter the egg hunt tomorrow. Are you? You might think it sounds like a kid's game but I take it VERY seriously.#$b#I have my strategy for domination all planned out, hehe!$h",
		"abigail.daily.spring_17": "What's up? Have you been talking with Seb or Sam much?#$b#We've been friends for as long as I can remember. We're like a gang or something.#$b#Oh, we definitely could use another member, you in?$h",
		"abigail.daily.spring_23": "Eh, the Flower Dance is tomorrow... the guys really hate it but it's not too bad. I do have to wear a dumb white dress though.#$b#Hey, if you ask Seb to dance, I won't have to put the dang thing on! Buuut only ask him if you really want to, no pressure!$h",

If I'm not doing homework, I'd love to come!#$b#I mean, it's more fun to go with someone than doing everything alone, right?#$b#We can bring the guys too if you want but I'd love to have an adventure with just the two of us.$h",

There's this really cute stuffed bat I'd love to get.$h",

Thanks for introducing yourself!#$b#I'm studying the local plants and animals from my home laboratory.#$b#Have you met my daughter Maru? She's interested in meeting you.#$b#I also have a step-son, Sebastian. He's usually in his room downstairs, he might be a little less excited to meet someone new.",
		"demetrius.daily.Mon": "Maru helps me out in the lab sometimes... She's a good kid. I started teaching her how to use lab equipment before she started elementary school.",
		"demetrius.daily.Mon4": "Ah, Maru was asking about you earlier, I think she's working on a project and would like your input.#$b#It's good to see her making close friends.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.Mon6": "I know I sound like a stuffy academic sometimes, Robin has pointed that out on occasion.#$e#Thank you for coming by to check on me at my lab, I do appreciate the company.",
		"demetrius.daily.Tue": "This valley has a very vibrant and diverse ecosystem. That's one reason I was excited to move here.#$e#Robin also loves the valley, she grew up here and it's her home.",
		"demetrius.daily.Tue4": "I'm off to gather some samples at the lake, I've been mapping out the ecosystem and all the species supporting the lake environment. It's fascinating work.#$e#If you happen to catch any fish you don't need, let me know. I might be able to use them, or they could become dinner, haha!",
		"demetrius.daily.Wed": "You're probably growing a lot of interesting plants on your farm, huh?#$e#Maybe I'll stop by your place some day and check it out. If you need any advice on the optimal conditions for a specific species, feel free to ask.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.Wed4": "How are your crops growing? I hope all is well.#$e#Have you built a greenhouse? Those are very handy in winter, or for growing any plants you want to harvest year-round.",
		"demetrius.daily.Wed6": "Hi @! How are you doing today?#$b#I wish I could make your farming job easier somehow. Be sure to let me and Maru know if there's anything we can do to help improve your farm.",
		"demetrius.daily.Thu4": "How are you today? I've had some minor breakthroughs in my lastest project so it's been a productive day so far.",
		"demetrius.daily.Fri": "I have noticed you chatting with Maru and Sebastian, they seem to enjoy your company.#$e#Sebastian works on his computer most of the day. Maybe you can encourage him to expand his interests.$u",
		"demetrius.daily.Fri4": "Hello @, it's good to see you. Be sure to talk with Robin if you haven't already, she enjoys your company.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.Sat2": "I do wish Sebastian would come out of his room more often, he's wasting his life locked in that basement. Robin is too soft on him sometimes.",

		"demetrius.daily.spring_Mon8": "It seems appropriate that Sebastian's knowledge of computers became the bridge between us, though I wish I had discovered how to reach him earlier.#$e#Well, there is nothing to gain by living in regret. I do hope I can build a solid relationship with him, it will take time and effort on both our parts, but I am determined to try.",

		"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed": "Maru and I already have much in common, so I've been attempting to find ways to bridge the gap between Sebastian and myself.#$e#It's challenging since he can be very emotional and difficult to understand.#$b#If you become friends, maybe you could offer some suggestions?",
		"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed4": "Hmm I've been working through some data from a previous study that relates to my current project, it's difficult to compare to the current data on my computer.#$b#It would be nice if I could have both datasets open side by side for comparison.",
		"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed6": "I mentioned the difficulty I was having with comparing my project data to Sebastian, he seemed intrigued by the problem and mumbled something about software coding.#$e#Sometimes I wonder what he's thinking about.",
		"demetrius.daily.summer_Wed8": "Sebastian installed a new program on my computer that he wrote to assist in my scientific data analysis.#$b#It's very useful, I can now easily compare the data from various studies and the program will filter and flag unique or similar entries.#$e#It has saved significant time and effort in my work. I mentioned it to some colleagues and they requested copies of the software.#$b#I'm proud to see my son's name as the program developer.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.summer_Thu4": "Robin has a hot temper. It's better to stay on her good side.#$b#...now if I could only quantify her mood levels, perhaps I could model the fluctuations using a sinusoidal curve...$u",

I'm always glad when you come for a visit, it's nice to have some company after all this lonely labwork.#$e#Sebastian has asked me about a few of my projects recently, he's making an effort. I hope he's honestly interested, I do like telling him about my work.",
		"demetrius.daily.fall_Wed8": "How are your crops growing this year? If you like, there are several tests I could run to map the various soil qualities to determine the optimum locations for each crop type.",
		"demetrius.daily.fall_Thu4": "Sebastian is very talented in the field of mechanics, he does well with hands-on work, similar to Robin.#$e#I do see some of her in him. Possibly I could find a project involving mechanics we could work on together.",
		"demetrius.daily.fall_Thu6": "When I was returning with samples from the lake, Sebastian was working on his motorcycle. I stopped to speak with him about the mechanics of the motorcycle engine.#$e#We had a pleasant conversation about some enhancements he'd like to make to the bike, I rather enjoyed it.",
		"demetrius.daily.fall_Thu8": "I want to help Sebastian with his motorcycle, do you think he would like to receive some engine parts for his birthday?#$e#Ah, yes, I will make sure they are the exact parts he wants for upgrading the bike, some of the things he mentioned are not purely focused on practical function.",
		"demetrius.daily.fall_Sun": "Hello, @, have you visited Sebastian today?#$b#I wonder if he had more friends, would his outlook improve? Hmm.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Mon4": "I might not seem like the romantic type, but I understand the importance of having someone by your side in life.#$e#I hope Maru and Sebastian always have life companions, whether that is close friendship or a romantic relationship.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Mon6": "@, do you have any recommendations for a romantic evening? I'd like to do something for Robin but I'm not confident I can plan an appropriate date.#$b#A nice dinner at the saloon in the private room with flowers? Hmm I think that could be successful, I'll let you know the results.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Mon8": "Thank you for your advice for an evening out with Robin, she greatly appreciated not needing to cook and she enjoyed the flowers.#$e#Maybe I will take her to see the algae growth I discovered recently.#$b#Oh? You doubt she would enjoy that? Hmm... you could be right, she might not appreciate the aesthetics of algae.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Wed6": "Sebastian insisted on making a 'snowgoon' by our house, it was so lopsided, I just don't understand why he does that. I asked him to take it down.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Wed8": "Why does Sebastian insist on building 'snowgoons'? They're asymetrical, it doesn't make sense. What's wrong with a snowman with perfectly aligned sections?#$e#*sighs* Oh well. I suppose that falls under the design aesthetic Robin always refers to.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Thu4": "Humph... Maru built a nice snowman and I told her how well it was designed. Sebastian rolled his eyes and built a 'snowgoon'. What is that boy thinking?",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Thu6": "Sebastian asked about one of my experiments today, he seemed genuinely interested.#$b#It seems his friends been a good influence on him.",
		"demetrius.daily.winter_Thu8": "I've been working through some of the data from a lake ecology study.#$e#Sebastian was genuinely interested and helped me organize it in a software program he designed for my work.$h",
		"demetrius.daily.summer_10": "Today is Maru's birthday, Robin and I are treating her to a special dinner.#$e#Sebastian is invited of course, but it's unlikely he will want to come.",
		"demetrius.reaction.dating_Sebastian": "I hear you and Sebastian are formally dating. To be honest, I'm glad he found you.#$b#I was becoming concerned that his lack of social skills would make it difficult for him to find a life partner.#$b#However, as Robin fondly reminded me, I was able to find someone so maybe I shouldn't have doubted him.$h",
		"demetrius.special.Tue_inlaw_Sebastian": "How's Sebastian doing on the farm?#$b#I hope he's helping but it's hard to imagine him working outside all day.#$b#However, he might be able to design you some software for farm management.$h",
		"demetrius.reaction.married_Alex": "How are things going on the farm? I hope Alex is helping, it's good that he enjoys working outside all day.#$b#Both Maru and Sebastian have been very excited about your marriage, I'm glad they have friends like you.$h",
		"demetrius.Event_Lab_Silence": "Well, we'd better titrate this solution before it crystallizes on us, this experiment is a little less forgiving than the kid ones.",
