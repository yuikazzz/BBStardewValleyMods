Spam Mail
====================

*this is one of the last things I worked on, last year. I figured it was better to just release it. Is it finished? Nah. Is there plenty of content? Sure. Am I going to update this in any reasonable time? No.*

Adds random spam mail. Makes NPCs react to the spam mail.

One thing that's always bothered me about the game is how static the dialogue is. Nothing...really changes, about ever. This was an attempt to inject additional conversation topics into the game.

That's about it.

## Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download and install [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Configuration

1. `ExpectedPlayTime`: In years, roughly how long you expect your save to last. This is used to space out the spam mail.

## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.6.15+ on Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. Fine for a single player to install in multiplayer.
* Should be compatible with most other mods.
