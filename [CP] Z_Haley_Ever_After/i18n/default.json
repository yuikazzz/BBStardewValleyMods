    "Haley.indoornight.221": "Poor Clint... Emily told me he won't stop leaving her gifts and love notes. It's sweet, but also kind of creepy.$s#$b#I feel bad for the guy, unrequited love is tough. But Em just doesn't see him that way.#$b#She says he reminds her too much of our dad, always tinkering in his shop instead of being present.#$b#I get it though, the heart wants what it wants... or doesn't want, I guess.$s",

I was chatting with Alex today and he was totally jealous of our relationship.#$b#He kept going on about how I'm too good for you, how he could make me so much happier... ha! As if.$s#$b#%Haley leans in close, nipping at your earlobe before trailing hot kisses along your jawline and down the column of your throat.#$b#I told him straight up - why would I want some immature jock when I've got someone strong and sexy like you in my bed every night?#$b#Someone who makes me moan their name every single time...$13",
    "Haley.indoornight.225": "*yawns* I was starting to think you got lost in those mines, dear.

I'm already so close.$l#$b#Think you can finish me off with that talented tongue of yours? I'll return the favor after...$13",
    "Haley.indoornight.227": "You know, it's funny... Emily and I used to fight like cats and dogs over the silliest things.#$b#Like who got to use the bathroom first or whose turn it was to pick what we watched on TV.$h#$b#But now that we don't live together anymore, all those little annoyances seem so trivial.#$b#I guess absence really does make the heart grow fonder... Either that or marriage has just made me a lot more zen about things.",

    "Haley.indoornight.237": "Do you know how hard it is to keep my hands off you when you're working out there in the fields?#$b#%Haley slips her hands into your hair, tugging your head back to expose your neck as she trails hot kisses along your jaw.#$b#You drive me crazy, @.

    "Haley.indoornight.238": "Hey you. I've been counting down the minutes until you got home.#$b#%Haley pulls you into a deep, deep kiss. It's not a hello kiss. It's messy and fierce, an 'I've been thinking about you nonstop' kiss.",
    "Haley.indoornight.239": "I've been a very good girl today, and I think it's time for my reward. You, naked, and ready to give me exactly what I need.$h",
    "Haley.indoornight.240": "I caught Penny gazing at you across the fields today. She looked so wistful... it's almost like she knows exactly what she's missing out on.#$b#But don't worry, I made sure to remind her, with a little wink, that you're all mine.$h",
    "Haley.indoornight.241": "I may have 'accidentally' let it slip to Alex that we spent all weekend in bed together.$h#$b#The look on his face was priceless, poor boy.#$b#%Haley giggles and starts kissing down your neck, fingers deftly unbuttoning your shirt.#$b#He could never satisfy me the way you do, @. You make me feel things I didn't even know were possible...$13",
    "Haley.indoornight.242": "You're home late... again.$s#$b#I was starting to get bored waiting for you. A girl has needs, you know?#$b#%Haley saunters over to you, a mischievous glint in her eye as she slides her hands up your chest and leans in close.#$b#What do you say, gorgeous? Feel like helping me out of these clothes and showing me what that talented mouth of yours can do?$13",
    "Haley.indoornight.243": "You smell so good, even after working in the fields all day. Musky and earthy... like pure sex.#$b#%Haley buries her face against your neck, breathing deep.

    "Haley.indoornight.247": "So Emily came over today and decided to give me a 'spiritual cleanse', which basically meant burning incense and chanting around the house.$s#$b#I love my sister, but she's such a weirdo. I'm just glad she didn't try to sage my designer handbag collection!$h",
    "Haley.indoornight.248": "I know this is gonna sound silly, but sometimes I still can't believe we ended up together like this.#$b#%Haley intertwines her fingers with yours, studying them in the flickering firelight.#$b#Like... if things had gone just a little differently, I might have been with Alex right now instead of your wife.$s#$b#Thank Yoba I came to my senses in time.",
    "Haley.indoornight.249": "Do you ever just stop and listen to the sounds of the night? The crickets, the wind through the trees...$h#$b#%Haley presses herself against your back, wrapping her arms around you.#$b#And then there's the sound of my heart racing every time you're near...$l",
    "Haley.indoornight.250": "Mmm, finally alone with my favorite person.#$b#%Haley presses up against you from behind, arms looping around your waist. Her breath tickles your neck as she nuzzles in close.#$b#I've been thinking about this moment all day... touching you, tasting you.$13",

I missed you a lot, is all, and it gets boring when you're away so much.$l",

    "Haley.indoornight.271": "Okay, confession time... I kind of miss hanging out with Alex. He may be an idiot but he was fun to gossip with!#$b#Maybe I should invite him over for a movie night? But like, make it super clear it's platonic.",
    "Haley.indoornight.272": "You won't believe this - I heard Jodi and Kent used to be swingers! No wonder she's always so eager to host those potlucks...$h#$b#I bet those 'special recipes' of hers are code for something way spicier than her famous tuna casserole.$11#$b#And here I thought they were just a boring old married couple!$h",

    "Haley.indoornight.276": "You remember that time I totally freaked out when I saw you talking to Abigail at the Flower Dance? I acted like such a jealous psycho.$s#$b#But it wasn't really about her.

    "Haley.indoornight.277": "I used to think I wanted my first time to be all perfect and planned out... like a scene from a romance movie.$l#$b#But honestly? Our messy, impulsive real-life moment was so much better.#$b#%Haley leans in for a slow, tender kiss.#$b#I wouldn't trade that memory for anything. You're my first... my only...

    "Haley.indoornight.female.98": "You know, I think about how awful I was to you when we first met... Always criticizing your fashion sense and acting like a total snob.$s#$b#Truth is, it had nothing to do with you. I was just so deep in the closet I practically lived in Narnia.$h#$b#Seeing you be so unapologetically yourself made me question everything... You shook my world up, baby.$13",
    "Haley.indoornight.female.99": "You know what I think? I think we should renew our vows sometime soon. Have a big ol' gay wedding right here on the farm...$h#$b#Show the whole valley how far we've come, and how damn proud we are to love each other.$11",

    "Haley.outdoor.33": "Ew, there's a slug on my boot! Gross!$s",
    "Haley.outdoor.34": "Guess what, love? I managed to coax a few of those wild bunnies into our yard. They're so adorable!$11#$b#It's like having our own little petting zoo. But remember, they're here for the cuddles, not the stew...$h",

    "Haley.outdoor.58": "Don't work too hard out here without me, okay?$s#$b#I worry that all these cute animals are gonna steal your heart away from me.#$b#*pouts* But if they keep giving us these delicious eggs and milk, I guess I can share.$h",
    "Haley.outdoor.59": "Oh, go ahead and do what you do. Don't mind me.$h#$b#I'm just here to enjoy the view.$l",
    "Haley.outdoor.60": "Another hard day of work, huh?#$b#I'll be here if you need me.",
    "Haley.outdoor.61": "I never thought I'd say this, but I actually kind of like working the land with you...#$b#There's something intimate about it, being close together, working towards a common goal...#$b#*blushes* I mean, not that kind of intimacy! I was just saying...$l#$b#Okay maybe a little bit of THAT kind too. You caught me.$h",
    "Haley.outdoor.62": "Ah, the great outdoors! Just me, you, and a million shades of green.$h",
