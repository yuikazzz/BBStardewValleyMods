IMPORTANT INFO!!!

1. Crops and flowers will need to be replanted if changing any growth and regrowth options. Crops already planted before changing settings
   will result in the crops retaining the growth/regrowth speeds BEFORE changing settings. So any changes to those settings will only apply
   to newly planted crops or flowers.

2. Sunflowers are the only flowers to not have regrowth enabled for the Flowers Can Regrow Without Replanting option. 
   This is due to a hardcoded issue with Sunflowers having their seeds drop when harvested. It'll work properly for the 1st harvest,
   but the 2nd harvest will only give the seeds, not the Sunflower itself. So for now, Sunflowers will not have the regrowth option
   available for it. But the good news is, the seeds have a chance to drop so you can just replant them on the get go.

3. If using the Increased Sell Value of Crops, Fruits, and Artisan Goods settings, Roe from Fish Ponds will not apply! Since they are
   Fish. You can however, download and install my mod Fishing Made Easy Suite (Link down below) and it has an option to increase the
   sell value of all fish!

4. When using the sell value settings for Crop, Fruit, Art, and Animal Products, it will only apply to newly acquired items AFTER you enable the setting you want.

5. If using the Prismatic Seeds from Animals settings, it is determined as follows:

 > For all animals except for Pigs and Hogs: It is determined if the day was a rainy or snowy day and if the day was a very lucky day. (Purple Star on TV).

 > For Pigs and Hogs: It is deterined if the day was a windy day and if the day was a very lucky day. (Purple Star on TV).

 > If those conditions have been met, you will get the Prismatic Seeds the day after.
