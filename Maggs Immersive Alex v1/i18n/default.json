	"alex.event.bestman.5": "... Uh, well, sure. But... why me?",
	"alex.event.bestman.6": "Um, I guess because in this whole town, you, @, and my grandparents are the ones who really understand me.#$b#You took the time to talk to me when I was conflicted about my relationship with @...#$b#And you were willing to be my friend even though I treated you like crap when we were younger.$s",

Get ready, @, I'm taking you out today.$h#$b#Don't worry about anything, Shane offered to help with the morning chores or whatever it is you do, and Alex is busy with the wedding decorating.#$b#Pfftt... sorry, I can't keep a straight face when I say 'Alex' and 'decorating' in the same sentence. Let alone 'wedding', haha!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.2": "Oh don't worry about anything, I have the whole time planned.#$b#We're getting breakfast at the saloon, walking out by the tide pools, stopping by the museum, and finally the bathhouse hot springs.#$b#C'mon, let's go!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.3": "Mmmm this looks amazing, eggs and bacon! What? Pfftt... no, I don't just eat salads.$h#$b#I mean, eating 'healthy' food is great and all, but I'm more of a 'whatever you like in moderation' kind of girl.#$b#I did have an ultra skinny phase, but it didn't last long. Actually, Alex got me out of that, he just kept bugging me and finally forced me to eat in front of him.#$b#He can be so stubborn sometimes! Though it was a good thing in that case.$11",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.4": "Speaking of food, back when we were in elementary school, Alex got it in his head to make an omelet since that's what the pro players ate.#$b#So we went over to his place and got all the stuff out, I told him to wait for his grandma, but oh no, he had to do it RIGHT NOW, ha!$h#$b#By the time he was done, there was egg on the counter, stove, floor, and smoke everywhere. The omelet was burnt to a crisp, full of egg shells, and half salt.#$b#He was so upset! Oh, not about the omelet, about his shoe!$h#$b#He had dropped an egg directly on his toe and the yolk got all in the laces. I swear he pouted over that for days after!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.5": "Mmmm this is delicious! Gus makes the best omelets, almost as good as Alex's. Luckily he didn't give up and finally learned to make some pretty amazing food!$11",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.6": "Time for a post-breakfast walk. The tide pools are really pretty this time of day, let's head down there.#$b#I bet we can just catch the late morning light and get some good photos.$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.7": "Ohhh I love the feeling of the sand between my toes, it's like an exfoliating spa treatment. Oh look! This pool is full of little creatures. I'll snap a couple of pics.$11",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.8": "Haley leans over the pool, her hair nearly touching the water...",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.9": "Oh blech! I hate when my hair gets ocean water on it, especially from these stagnant pools, the smell is terrible!$s",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.10": "The worst ever was a few years back when Alex and Dusty were down here, Dusty was sticking his nose in all the pools, like dogs do, and found a crab.#$b#Alex told him not to play with the thing, but he didn't listen and ended up with a claw on his tail. Boy did he yelp!#$b#He jumped all over the place, splashing in all the pools, sand and starfish flying everywhere, it was a mess!#$b#I got water sloshed all over me, seaweed stuck in my hair, I was soaked! Totally ruined my new summer skirt.$s#$b#Of course Alex tried to tackle Dusty and landed face-first in a pool, he was lucky a crab didn't get him too!$h#$b#Thinking back, it must have looked hilarious but at the time, I was furious...#$b#I've forgiven Dusty since then, for the most part anyway, haha!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.11": "Heh, I can just imagine Dusty trying to escape the crab on his tail, Haley drenched and steaming, Alex face-down in a tide pool.#This day out is proving to be quite the glimpse into Alex as a kid!",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.12": "Let's get our feet rinsed off, the museum should be open now, I want to show you something.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.13": "*whispers loudly* It's so quiet in here... ugh, I hated coming here as a kid. It was so boring, and I was never the studious type, big surprise.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.14.1": "Oh over here, there they are! Look, look!",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.14.2": "I took these photos of the valley, see, this is from the ridge above the bathhouse, and that's by the Cindersap waterfalls.$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.15": "Gunther liked them so much, he gave me permission to hang them here to record how the valley looks now compared to those old-timey photos over there.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.16": "The photos are amazing, Haley did an excellent job. I'm not surprised Gunther wanted to display them.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.17": "Look over here, see this window frame? It's been repaired along the sill here. Guess who did that? Ha! Yep, Alex of course!#$b#He was out showing off, messing around with his gridball like usual, and accidentally threw it through the window!#$b#Gunther was SO MAD, he stormed out of the building, holding the ball over his head, his face red as a magma slime.#$b#Alex just stood there, his mouth hanging open like a fish and totally got busted.$h#$b#Don't tell him I told you, but he was bawling his eyes out after that, I actually felt sorry for him.$s#$b#He did community service and cleaned up the flower beds and stuff around the museum to pay Gunther back.#$b#After that, Alex was a lot more careful where he played with his ball, that's for sure!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.18": "Huh, I guess it's turned into Alex story time, haha!$h#$b#Oh well, how about the bathhouse next? I got a new suit so I might as well try it out.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.19": "Ahhh, nothing like the hot springs when you need to relax. It'll get the ocean smell off our feet for sure.#$b#It's not so great on skunk smell though, heehee! One more Alex story, okay?$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.20": "Once, Alex and Dusty were out in the hills hiking or whatever it is they do, and Dusty got sprayed by a skunk, the doofus.#$b#Anyway, he stunk so bad, Alex had tears running down his face when they got back.#$b#Dusty was too big for the bathtub, so Alex decided to take him up here and wash him in the showers.#$b#He brought a bunch of cans of tomato sauce and dumped them all over the dog, it looked like a crime scene!#$b#Of course, Dusty was all excited and started running around, knocking stuff over and shaking tomato sauce everywhere.$h#$b#Alex eventually got him scrubbed down and spent probably hours cleaning up the locker room and pool area.#$b#But that skunk smell was undeniable, the entire place smelled like a skunk frat party for weeks!#$b#Lewis assumed a skunk had somehow gotten in, and never actually figured out what happened. Luckily he's not very fond of Dusty and never goes near him.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.21": "Well, I don't want to become a prune, so let's head back to my place.",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.22": "You know, Alex has grown up a lot since you moved here. I have too, actually.#$b#I'm really glad he found someone like you, the two of you are perfect for each other, you'll keep him out of trouble, or at least rescue him, haha!$h",
	"alex.event.haleydayout.23.extraspicy": "*squints* I've been dying to ask... how is he... as a lover? You don't have to tell me any details, I'm just super curious.#$b#I mean, I did see him naked once, we were in elementary school and he lost his shorts in the pool and nearly died on the spot, but I really don't think that counts.$h",
